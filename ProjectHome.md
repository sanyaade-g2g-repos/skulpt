## About ##

Skulpt is an _entirely in-browser_ implementation of Python.

[Live demo at skulpt.org](http://www.skulpt.org)

## How to contribute ##

### Create a repository clone where you can make changes: ###

  * Go to http://code.google.com/p/skulpt/source/clones, click 'Create a clone'
  * Fill in name, summary, description, click 'Create repository clone'
  * Click on 'Administer', 'Source'. Enable 'Allow non-members to review code', click 'Save changes'

### Make your changes: ###

  * Make your changes to the source code, then "hg commit", "hg push". This makes your change visible to everyone
  * I review your change, make some comments. You repeat previous step: make changes, commit and push
  * The process repeats until we are both happy. Then, I integrate your change in the main branch
  * You can delete your clone if it is not needed anymore

## Mercurial and general patch workflow ##

Another project on Google Code has documented this well, see http://code.google.com/p/mytracks/wiki/DevelopmentProcess (of course replacing the "mytracks" with "skulpt" as appropriate).
